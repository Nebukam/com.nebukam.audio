- Frequency isolation is _heavily_ inspired by [Soundkeys](https://www.maxon.net/en/red-giant-complete/trapcode-suite/sound-keys)
- The FFT arythmetic is a Unity-friendly refactor of [DSPLib](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1107480/DSPLib-FFT-DFT-Fourier-Transform-Library-for-NET-6)
- The demo scene uses [Atmosphere](https://freesound.org/people/DaveJf/sounds/608928/) by [DaveJf](https://freesound.org/people/DaveJf/)  
<sup>_downloaded from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/)_</sup>
- Also includes audio test files from [Hearing Test HD](https://www.audiocheck.net/testtones_highdefinitionaudio.php) to demonstrate & test the sampling accuracy.
